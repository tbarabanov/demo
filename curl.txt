If you use the --request / -X option you can change the method keyword curl selects, but you will not modify curl's behavior. This means that if you for example use -d "data" to do a POST, you can modify the method to a PROPFIND with -X and curl will still think it sends a POST.

CREATE
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/greeting" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"content\":\"hello, world\"}"

READ
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/greeting" -H "Content-Type: application/json"

UPDATE
// TODO: what did we miss???
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8080/greeting?id=0488ecf4-a65a-4adf-8477-a19f941202bc" -H "Content-Type: application/json"

DELETE
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/greeting?id=0488ecf4-a65a-4adf-8477-a19f941202bc" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
